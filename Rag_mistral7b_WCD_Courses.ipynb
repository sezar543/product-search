      " content ::::  What our graduates are saying Laura Vieira Graduated 2021 | Reviewed on 17 October 2021 “Amazing course and support” The course was really great a little too fast if you are not in a technical field already. You will need to study hard reviewing classes and making the labs and assignments but you always have the support of the TAs (they are awesome) or even the instructors and your own classmates that are always helping each other via Slack. There will be a final project where you will need to present a pipeline that you created (don’t worry they will be helping you!). Then, they will be helping you to find a job. Shaohua is always looking for the best for his students, he wants to make sure that you have the best experience with them.      5/5      5/5 \n",

      " content ::::  FAQ Frequently asked questions about the bootcamp What's the difference between this course and the WeCloudOpen SQL and Python courses? WeCloudOpen courses are self-paced. We created free python and sql courses for our learners. The Data Fundamental Course is delivered via live classes. Students get to interact with instructors and teaching assistants. We cover use cases and teach students how to complete mini projects. It’s a great way to get started with data analytics. Do I need to complete this course in order to get into WeCloudData's Data Bootcamps? We strongly recommend students to complete the data fundamental course before attending the Data Analytics, Data Science, and Data Engineering bootcamps. Students who can prove that they have relevant python and sql skills can be exempted from attending the fundamental course. Do I get a discount or scholarship once I complete this course and pass the test? The tuition cost of the Fundamental course will be waived when the student join any Data Bootcamp. To get the tuition reimbursement, students need to attend 80% of the classes and pass the course completion criteria. How are the classes structured? The lectures are designed to be hands-on. We don’t cover many slides and theories in the fundamental course. We suppose that the students can take WeCloudOpen’s free SQL and Python courses for the basics and details. Instructors will do live demo and expect the students to follow along and complete exercises during some of the classes. Will I get live TA support? Yes. During each class, the instructors will answer student questions. During the lab sessions that are led by the teaching assistants, students get help from the TAs. We also provide project mentoring sessions in the last week, before the final project presentation. There’re plenty of opportunity to interact with the faculty team and classmates. Does this course offer hands-on project? Yes! The course is designed to be hands-on and practical. We cover use cases and mini-projects. Over the period of 6 weeks, students will also need to complete a small capstone project. Does this course teach how to pass interview tests? No, this is a fundamental course that prepares learners for more advanced data topics. It’s the perfect course to dip your toes into the world of data analytics. It helps you overcome of the fear of programming, helps you understand the basics, and give you the confidence to dive deeper into more advanced topics. WeCloudData is the leading data science and AI academy. Our blended learning courses have helped thousands of learners and many enterprises make successful leaps in their data journeys. \n"

      " content ::::  FAQ Frequently asked questions about the bootcamp What's the difference between this course and the WeCloudOpen SQL and Python courses? WeCloudOpen courses are self-paced. We created free python and sql courses for our learners. The Data Fundamental Course is delivered via live classes. Students get to interact with instructors and teaching assistants. We cover use cases and teach students how to complete mini projects. It’s a great way to get started with data analytics. Do I need to complete this course in order to get into WeCloudData's Data Bootcamps? We strongly recommend students to complete the data fundamental course before attending the Data Analytics, Data Science, and Data Engineering bootcamps. Students who can prove that they have relevant python and sql skills can be exempted from attending the fundamental course. Do I get a discount or scholarship once I complete this course and pass the test? The tuition cost of the Fundamental course will be waived when the student join any Data Bootcamp. To get the tuition reimbursement, students need to attend 80% of the classes and pass the course completion criteria. How are the classes structured? The lectures are designed to be hands-on. We don’t cover many slides and theories in the fundamental course. We suppose that the students can take WeCloudOpen’s free SQL and Python courses for the basics and details. Instructors will do live demo and expect the students to follow along and complete exercises during some of the classes. Will I get live TA support? Yes. During each class, the instructors will answer student questions. During the lab sessions that are led by the teaching assistants, students get help from the TAs. We also provide project mentoring sessions in the last week, before the final project presentation. There’re plenty of opportunity to interact with the faculty team and classmates. Does this course offer hands-on project? Yes! The course is designed to be hands-on and practical. We cover use cases and mini-projects. Over the period of 6 weeks, students will also need to complete a small capstone project. Does this course teach how to pass interview tests? No, this is a fundamental course that prepares learners for more advanced data topics. It’s the perfect course to dip your toes into the world of data analytics. It helps you overcome of the fear of programming, helps you understand the basics, and give you the confidence to dive deeper into more advanced topics. WeCloudData is the leading data science and AI academy. Our blended learning courses have helped thousands of learners and many enterprises make successful leaps in their data journeys.  and gnerate the answer for the Who are instructors of Data Engineering Bootcamp?.
